The process of calculating the price of an insurance policy
is typically referred to as "underwriting".
Underwriting involves assessing the risk of insuring a particular
individual or entity, based on factors such as age, health, occupation,
location, and other relevant information.
Once the risk has been assessed, the insurer can then determine
the appropriate premium to charge for the policy,
based on the likelihood of a claim being made and the potential cost
of that claim. Underwriting is a key part of the
insurance industry, as it helps to ensure that premiums are set at a
level that is fair and sustainable for both the insurer and the
policyholder.
